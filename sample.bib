	abstract = {Certifying the behavior of autonomous systems is essential to the development and deployment of systems in safety-critical applications. This paper presents an approach to using a correct-by-construction controller with the probabilistic results of dynamic obstacle anticipation, and validates the approach with experimental data obtained from Cornell's full-scale autonomous vehicle. The obstacle anticipation (used to calculate the probability of collision with dynamic obstacles around the vehicle) is abstracted to a set of Boolean observations, which are then used by the synthesized controller (a state machine generated from temporal logic task specifications). The obstacle anticipation, sensor abstraction, and synthesized controller are implemented on a full-scale autonomous vehicle, and experimental data are collected and compared with a formal analysis of the probabilistic behavior of the system. A comparison of the results shows good agreement between the formal analysis and the experimental results.}

	abstract="In the near future mobile robots, such as personal robots or mobile manipulators, will share the workspace with other robots and humans. We present a method for mission and motion planning that applies to small teams of robots performing a task in an environment with moving obstacles, such as humans. Given a mission specification written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in conjunction with a distributed motion planner that guarantees avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct-by-construction synthesis approach to multi-robot mission planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2) it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesizing and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic obstacles. In contrast to many existing approaches to mission and motion planning, it is scalable with the number of moving obstacles. We demonstrate the approach in physical experiments with walking humanoids moving in 2D environments and in simulation with aerial vehicles (quadrotors) navigating in 2D and 3D environments.",

We describe the context of the problem, as part of the Prosyd European Project which aims to provide a property-based development flow for hardware designs. Within this project, synthesis plays an important role, first in order to check whether a given specification is realizable, and then for synthesizing part of the developed system.",

	abstract = { We present a receding horizon method for controlling an autonomous vehicle that must satisfy a rich mission specification over service requests occurring at the regions of a partitioned environment. The overall mission specification consists of a temporal logic statement over a set of static, a priori known requests, a regular expression over a set of dynamic requests that can be sensed only locally, and a servicing priority order over these dynamic requests. Our approach is based on two main steps. First, we construct an abstraction for the motion of the vehicle in the environment by using input–output linearization and assignment of vector fields to the regions in the partition. Second, a receding horizon controller computes local plans within the sensing range of the vehicle such that both local and global mission specifications are satisfied. We implement and evaluate our method through experiments and simulations consisting of a quadrotor performing a persistent surveillance task over a planar grid environment. }
